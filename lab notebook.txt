Data exploration, RCMB56

web_summary.html
	Our data have low ATAC and RNA coverage, as expected for lcWGS QC.
	Estimated number of cells	10,738
	Clustering done separately on RNA and ATAC features. Can I find a joint classifier?
	ATAC:
		Median high-quality fragments per cell	1,414
		Number of peaks	184,234
	RNA:
		Median genes per cell	161
		Total genes detected	20,965

Read filtering
ATAC
	Each unique genomic region can only map to at most 1 ATAC read
	(Why not use barcodes to distinguish duplicates?)
RNA
	Counts include transcriptomic, intronic and exonic reads.
	

Dimensionality reduction
RNA
	PCA (IRLBA algorithm), 10 components.
ATAC
	Inverse-document frequency (idf) transform (greater weight to counts of peaks which occur in few barcodes)
	SVD (IRLBA), 15 components
	Depth normalization - each barcode to L2 norm in 15d.
	Spherical k-means

Clustering & Visualization - on DR data
	spherical k-means
	t-SNE
	UMAP

Why do I have 2 almost identical differential_expression.csv files under both ATAC and gex?

Loupe Tutorial
Loupe is the broswer for copy number estimation in CellRanger's single-cell DNA
pipeline. Notably not ATAC, but let's see what it can do.

Basic functionality: Hierarchical clustering groups cells on the right by CN (20MB bins).
Can zoom, get a region/gene, or get a subtree. Top browser shows current node's descendants;
bottom browser shows node.

Tuesday meeting
Yingxi

- Presented hierarchical clustering on meta-cells.
- Jill: what is the distribution of scores?
- Owen: Plot scores on 1d axis, take top 10%?
- Jill: column normalization, or no normalization on clustering.
- Jill: use GO ontology sets?
- Owen: gene sets for ecdnas 1,2,3

Hi Yingxi,
	Attached are bed files corresponding to amplified genes (including partial amplifications) on RCMB56 ecDNAs 1 and 2.I've also 
	attached a bed containing all regions I think are in ecDNA 3, but genes are not annotated on this one. 
	Outline of steps to generate a .gmt file of sets of genes corresponding to each ecDNA:
	- Download the gencode reference set. Pick your favorite format, GTF and GFF3 are pretty similar. 
	- Filter for protein-coding genes. Using awk, a template command would be:
	awk '{if($3=="transcript" && $20=="\"protein_coding\";"){print $0}}' gencode.gtf
	- Parse into bed. Keep the gene names.
	- bedtools intersect -wa will give you genes overlapping the ecDNA.
	- Parse into gmt.
Yours,Owen

scATAC-seq bam files

METHODS
idk what I'm looking for; just getting familiar with the data.

RESULTS
- bam files are large - 32 and 16Gb.
- Can see the ends of the ecDNAs in the atac coverage. ht more obvious than pdx.
- peaks are highly highly enriched for signal, but they account for a minority of total sequence.
- CB is cell barcode name
- discordant reads appear in the scATAC data.
- Examining the atac_fragments.tsv.gz file, it looks like using barcode info would dramatically alter
	counts per barcode per peak - there are ~4 different cells with the same read at the beginning of
	chr1, and that's not even an ecDNA region.

Permutation test for detecting ecDNA

GOAL
We need a distribution to estimate the probability that a normal genomic region could
generate this many reads at the ecDNA locus. 

METHODS
/expanse/lustre/projects/csd677/collab/projects/scRNA+ATAC/2021-07-26_enrich_vs_permuted_bkgd/
/mnt/c/Users/ochapman/Documents/Mesirov/scRNA+ATAC/2021-08-02_featurecounts_permutation
Wrote a script to perform generate 1000 random features of the same length as the ecDNA, and 
 featurecounts each random interval for each cell.
This was clearly very inefficient. 12 hours on a dedicated compute node gave me 128 finished permutations.
Then, we can estimate p-values 2 ways:
 - empirical: how many times do we randomly get this many or more reads in a random region?
 - poisson: fit ML poisson distribution to the random permutations, compute p-value for the poisson.

RESULTS
Both implemented correctly, and both look pretty good at distinguishing ecDNA+ cells. 
Probably need more random samples to accurately estimate p-values though.
Also, the permutation test is very expensive and time-consuming.

DISCUSSION
Can we make the permutation test more efficient?
Run more permutations.

 z-score vs RNA embeddings
	PC4. r=-.17. Negative.
	
RCMB56-pdx, ecDNA2
 z-score vs ATAC embeddings
	PC9. r=-0.44. If you squint?
 z-score vs RNA embeddings
	PC2. r=-0.28. Negative.
	
RCMB56-pdx, ecDNA3
 z-score vs ATAC embeddings
	PC1. r=-0.44. Sequencing depth.
 z-score vs RNA embeddings
	PC2. r=-0.21. Negative.

- Weak correlation between ecDNA1 z-score and DNTTIP2 expression.
- Weak correlations between some ecDNA z-scores and cell embeddings.
- Bizarre nonlinear function relates ht ecDNAs 1 and 2 to rna pc2.

Clusters against ecDNA predictions

BACKGROUND AND METHODS
2021-08-31_correlate-ecDNA-status/correlate-ecDNA.ipynb

I have T/F ecDNA classifications, and ~10 clusters. The appropriate statistical
 test here is Fisher's exact or chi-sq.

Chi-sq or fisher's exact? 
 Handbook of Biological statistics says Chi-sq.

DISCUSSION
Tests say there's significant deviation, but the effect size is very minor. 
There are a lot of clusters here. Re-run with lower cluster number?
Increase resolution parameter?

(How do I decide what an optimal resolution is?)

MetaCell

BACKGROUND
We are still looking for a way to measure RNA expression of ecDNA genes against their ecDNA
predictions. Alex suggested MetaCell:
https://github.com/tanaylab/metacell/
https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-019-1812-2
Which uses a knn-based approach to build small clusters of ~20 cells as "metacells" which
are transcriptionally similar.

METHODS
conda activate metacell
R
install.packages("RSvgDevice_0.6.4.4.tar.gz", repos=NULL, type="source")
if (!require("BiocManager")) install.packages('BiocManager') 
BiocManager::install("remotes")
BiocManager::install("tanaylab/metacell")

Running on expanse scRNA+ATAC feature set
/expanse/lustre/projects/csd677/collab/projects/scRNA+ATAC/2021-09-07_metacell
Derived largely from code at:
https://tanaylab.github.io/metacell/articles/a-basic_pbmc8k.html

RESULTS
27 metacells from 2739 high-variance features.
Sure looks like these metacells are just defined by sequencing depth... See 
 rcmb56-ht_KEGG_CELL_CYCLE.png heatmap.

Correlation with ARHGAP29

BACKGROUND
ARHGAP29 shows as much more highly "expressed" in metacell heatmaps. Is it a better candidate
oncogene?

METHODS
Generated correlations with ARHGAP29 to ecDNA z-scores alongside DNTTIP2
Compared distribution of normalized UMI counts between ARHGAP29 and DNTTIP2 (seurat)

RESULTS
Almost zero correlation between ARHGAP29 and ecDNA1 z-score.
ARHGAP29 expressed at much lower absolute level than DNTTIP2.

DISCUSSION
What is going on with overall single cell expression distributions?
Could be that the heatmaps are not sample- and gene-normalized.

Inconsistent classifications between copy-scAT and poisson permutation test

BACKGROUND
My permutation test calls much more ecDNA than copy-scAT. More sensitive test, or false positives?
Jill suggested I visually examine cells which copy-scAT classifies as ecDNA- and I classify as
 ecDNA+.
 
METHODS
bigwigs generated on cluster at /expanse/lustre/projects/csd677/collab/projects/scRNA+ATAC/bigwig/
igv session at ~/Documents/Mesirov/scRNA+ATAC/2021-08-27_Kazachkova/bigwig/RCMB56-pdx/

RESULTS
It's noisy data, and the signal is there but not glaringly obvious. By visual examination, all F/T
 cells I randomly selected have enriched scATAC-seq reads at the known ecDNA1 location; and enrichment
 is comparable, but perhaps slightly less, than T/T cells by comparison.

nCounts_RNA threshold

BACKGROUND
Seurat recommends nCount_RNA > 1000 in its tutorials, but many of the RCMB56-ht cells have between 
 100 and 1000 UMIs. Is there good reason to keep these?

METHODS
Literature search.

RESULTS

Harvard Chan Bioinformatics Core: https://hbctraining.github.io/scRNA-seq/lessons/04_SC_quality_control.html
 "The UMI counts per cell should generally be above 500, that is the low end of what we expect. 
 If UMI counts are between 500-1000 counts, it is usable but the cells probably should have been 
 sequenced more deeply."

UCD/UCSF: https://ucdavis-bioinformatics-training.github.io/2019-single-cell-RNA-sequencing-Workshop-UCD_UCSF/scrnaseq_analysis/scRNA_Workshop-PART2.html
 "We use the information above to filter out cells. Here we choose those that have percent 
  mitochondrial genes max of 10% and unique UMI counts under 20,000 or greater than 500."
 
Seurat Guided Clustering Tutorial
 "We filter cells that have unique feature counts over 2,500 or less than 200
 We filter cells that have >5% mitochondrial counts"

    nCount_ATAC > 5e3 &

    nCount_RNA > 1000 &
    percent.mt < 20
)"

) -> data

BaRC Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research: http://barc.wi.mit.edu/education/hot_topics/scRNAseq_2020/SingleCell_Seurat_2020.html
seurat <- subset(seurat, subset = nFeature_RNA > 350 & nFeature_RNA < 5000 & percent.mt < 10)

DISCUSSION
Many groups don't use UMI counts per cell at all; they instead prefer to threshold on number of distinct genes.
Seurat recommends nCount_RNA > 1000, and I saw 2 workshops from reputable sources saying at least 500.
Based on this, will adjust minimum threshold to 500.

metacells and seurat clusters

Which metacells correspond to which clusters, and vice-versa?

METHODS
see /scRNA+ATAC/2021-09-07_metacell/metacells_and_clusters.ipynb

RESULTS

cluster 0 is composed of ~26 small metacells.
cluster 1 is composed of most of mcs 1,2,5,6,11
cluster 2 is also composed of ~26 metacells. Much overlap with 1.
cluster 3 has contributions from many, but the majority of mcs 7,8,9,10
cluster 4 is mc 3
cluster 5 is mc 13
cluster 6 is mcs 14,15,16
cluster 7 is mc 20
cluster 8 is mc 17
cluster 9 is mc 19, part of 18
cluster 10 is mc 18

TODO:
Put metacells on that ecDNA1,2 correlation thing.

KMT2E, aka MLL5

MLL5 Orchestrates a Cancer Self-Renewal State by Repressing the Histone Variant H3.3 and Globally Reorganizing Chromatin
MLL5 (KMT2E): structure, function, and clinical relevance
	CD domain binds p53 tetramer!
	
DISCUSSION
Add MLL5 to manuscript.

9/15/2021

NB: Correlated KMT2E against ecDNA2.
 rcmb56-ht, ecDNA1 vs DNTTIP2 -- r=0.29
 rcmb56-ht, ecDNA2 vs KMT2E ---- r=0.42
 rcmb56-pdx, ecDNA1 vs DNTTIP2 - r=0.48
 rcmb56-pdx, ecDNA2 vs KMT2E --- r=0.57

Correlate ecDNA z-scores to gene expression, aggregated at metacell level.

RESULTS

rcmb56-ht, ecDNA1 vs DNTTIP2.
Outliers in both distributions, so Pearson invalid.
SpearmanrResult(correlation=0.47579737335834904, pvalue=0.0019152445344766435)
High values metacells 11, 12, 13

rcmb56-ht, ecDNA2 vs KMT2E.
SpearmanrResult(correlation=0.24709193245778616, pvalue=0.12425968094198284)
High values metacells 11, 12, 13

DISCUSSION
Spearman correlation present but insignificant. Pearson has outliers but outliers are high 
on both axes so they don't deviate much from the line of best fit. Pearson ok then?
